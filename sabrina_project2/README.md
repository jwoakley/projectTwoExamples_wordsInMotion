# Sabrina's Project 02

### Project Overview

<h5>This project focuses on community and what it means to me by using any written word. For this project, I decided to use the theme song of the movie High School Musical "We're All In This Together" because the lyrics do speak for itself because it talks about how different people can always be united. It's an iconic movie produced by Disney and the lyrics of the song embody community.</h5>
