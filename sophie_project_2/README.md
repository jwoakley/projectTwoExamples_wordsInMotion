# Project 2: Words of Community
By Sophie R. 

# Project overview 
This website displays a poem with animated text and words. The poem, titled Ekphrasis on my Rapists Wedding Dress, by Torrin A Greathouse. I picked this poem based off my chosen communty, encompasses by the word "consent". I chose this as I did a fair amount of work around consent and sexual assault awareness in highschool, as well as in reflection around the two cases that have come out against the sports teams at USF.

# Technical overview 
How to use this project is fairly straightforward. The text is interactive, either through clicking or hovering over the text, in order to begin the animations. The websites are both side scrolls, rather than a vertical scroll. The website is made of two pages, each containing their respective halfs of the poem. In order to click in the the second page, one must click on the word "red" at the end of page 1. The concept is to begin with a soft color palette, and then agressively transition to a darker palette, to reflect a change in tone, as the poem becomes more dark.

The first animation, on the first page, is the title fading out. I wanted to utilize the transition, so that the title istelf didn't feel imposing. The second is with the words screen & glow, both turning yellow to mimic their word's meanings. Finally the word orgin is coded to be reduced in size.

After clicking on the word red, the first animation on the second page is the word suspended, in which the individual letters rise up, to mimic the meaning of the word. As the user continues to scroll, the second animation is the word "violence" turning red, once hovered over. Fianlly, as the poem comes to the end, the ending word "dance" is animated, with the letters moving as well as getting bigger, as I felt this signaled the end to the poem.
<br>
All in all, althoguh the animations are simple, I mainly wanted to accentuate the poem, rather than overpower its words and meanings
