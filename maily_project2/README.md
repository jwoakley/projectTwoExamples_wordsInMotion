# Project 2: Words in Motion

### By Mai Ly Torres Baker

# project overview

This website has been created for my second project within my Visual Communications II course. At the start of the project we were asked "What does community mean to you?" and had to find words that convey our sense of community. I chose to write a pantoum poem which is composed of 4 stanzas with 4 lines each. A line from the previous stanza carries on to the next. Throughout the poem I have wrote each line to describe what community means to me and when I feel a sense of community. Community means many things to me but some moments I recall are: when I am sitting around the dinner table with family, building connections with people from all walks of life, and spending wholesome moments with friends. With the poem, I hope to convey a message of where I have found community. I have also chosen to create a changing gradient across the backgrounds to depict a setting sun because I have shared many treasured sunset moments with those I love. These moments have filled me with a sense of community.  

# technical overview

This website has been created within Visual Studio Code using HTML 5 and CSS 3. Much of the coding is based in CSS 3 by using transformations, hover effects, and animations. I have used @keyframes animations to have the lines come on to the pages one by one. I used hover effects on lines that you have to click on to get to the next page. On hover, the letters space out and the line grows. The linear gradient background that depicts a sunset is a CSS background-attatchment. On the first stanza, I used animation to have the page transition from white into a colorful gradient.
