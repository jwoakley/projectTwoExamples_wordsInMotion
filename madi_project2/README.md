# words in motion project

# project overview

The purpose of my project is to showcase Mila D. Aguilar's "For Nelia," a piece of poetry that connects me with my community, in a creative way. I wanted to focus on this poem because it provides commentary on the expectations that women, particularly Filipina women, are faced with to be submissive and flexible--like a bamboo--rather than headstrong and firm--like a rock. It reminds me of the community that I’ve been able to connect with after I moved to San Francisco in USF’s Filipinx-American organization (Kasamahan) as well as the classes I’ve taken in the Philippine Studies program. After engaging in both, I've been aided by guidance and  connections that I've made in USF's Filipinx community to become more of the person I want to be--someone who is like the rock described in the poem. I also feel a connection as a Filipina artist spotlighting another Filipina’s artist’s written word in this project, forming a connection despite being a part of the diaspora.

# technical overview

The website utilizes HTML and CSS. Each section of the vertical long-scrolling page aims to highlight and dissect each stanza of the poem, but through typography and animation. Earth tones connect back to the nature and richness of the motherland (the Philippines.) The animations included in the website aim to echo the "physical" nature of the poem--i.e. the poet's use of words that envoke movement and motion. I also wanted the animations to highlight key words in the poem through transform effects, skewed effects, color changes, and more.

The current status of the website is finished. The HTML is organized by stanza of the poem. The CSS is completed as well, separated by stanzas and a separate section for keyframes.
